# CCLE-CERES ICT Analysis

A comprehensive cancer genomics analysis pipeline that integrates CERES dependency scores, CCLE expression data, and ICT (ion channel and transporter) gene lists to identify therapeutic targets and characterize cancer cell line relationships.

---

## Overview

This repository provides tools for analyzing cancer cell line dependencies using data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and CERES (Cancer Dependency Map) databases. The pipeline focuses on ion channel and transporters (ICT) genes and their dependencies across different cancer types.
